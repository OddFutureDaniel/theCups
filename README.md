# theCups

### About

Throughout my university career I would (and many other students) regularly visit my now favourite Japanese noodle bar called 'The Cups'.

Most well known for their CupBap's consisting of a base (Noodles,Rice) and a topping (Kastu chicken, chicken teriyaki, spicy pork belly etc.) I instantly fell in love.

### Motivation

When lockdown hit the nation back in 2020 they were made to move to takeaway only, doing so on popular takeaway apps.

My motivation is 2-fold. Firstly, I'd like to showcase my UI/UX design skills past adapting a previous design by creating a UI from scratch. 
Secondly I'd like to show my gratitude to this fine establishment by designing them their first website. 


### Technical

Making use of CSS3, HTML5 and Javascript
